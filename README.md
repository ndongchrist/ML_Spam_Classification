# üìß Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning project to classify emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using natural language processing (NLP). The model uses techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and compares multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

---

## üöÄ Features

- Text preprocessing with TF-IDF
- Trained and validated on the `completespamassasin` dataset
- Compared multiple models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM
- Best performance with **SVM** (98%+ accuracy)
- Save and reuse model for prediction
- CLI script to test your own email

---

## üóÇ Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - arXiv Spam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv)
- File used: `completespamassasin.csv`
- Columns:
  - `Body`: The content of the email
  - `Label`: 0 = Ham, 1 = Spam

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### üîß Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> If `requirements.txt` is not provided, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## üß™ How to Train the Model

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `spam_classifier.ipynb` or your Python script.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Vectorize text using TF-IDF.
4. Train using the best model (e.g., SVM).
5. Save the model:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(svm_model, 'spam_classifier_model.pkl')
joblib.dump(vectorizer, 'tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')
```

---

## ü§ñ Predict with Your Own Email (CLI)

Run the `classify_email.py` script to test any email string:

```bash
python classify_email.py "Win a brand new iPhone now! Click here to claim."
```

### Sample Output:

```
Prediction: SPAM
```

This uses the saved model and vectorizer (`.pkl` files).

## üìä Model Comparison Summary

| Model               | Accuracy  |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Logistic Regression | 96.6%     |
| Naive Bayes         | 89.7%     |
| **SVM (Best)**      | **98.6%** |
